  - Talk about escaping
  - Maybe recap how everything works (duplicate with tutorial)
  - Advertise binary (cargo install) and library
- Settings:
  - "Reset" button
  - "Don't save/restore input" checkbox
  - Show/Hide some stuff (like file encoding/decoding, or specification, etc.)
- Tutorial:
  - Enter 3 different inputs that decode to "hello" with GD3BWuF6sDkrLw
  - Advertise binary (cargo install) and library
- Add support for saving custom encodings (another dropdown below presets)
- Add support for file upload/download
- Code snippet to create the encoding
- Save URL every 100ms if it changed to allow back button
- Review and cleanup all code:
  - Go over all title (tooltip) and placeholder attributes
  - Consider using https://github.com/koute/stdweb
